# ❤️ HeartGraph

A Python project that plots a **heart-shaped graph** using **Matplotlib** and **NumPy**.  
Designed to practice **mathematical visualization and plotting techniques**.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project draws a **heart shape** using mathematical formulas and Python plotting.  
It demonstrates **how equations can be visualized** and turned into attractive graphics.

---

## ✨ Features
- ❤️ Plots a heart-shaped curve using NumPy arrays  
- 🎨 Customizable colors and size  
- 🖥️ Beginner-friendly project for visualization practice  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **Libraries:** Matplotlib, NumPy  

---

## 📚 How It Works
1. NumPy arrays are used to **calculate coordinates** for the heart curve.  
2. Matplotlib **plots the points and fills the shape**.  
3. Colors and styling can be adjusted to create different visual effects.
